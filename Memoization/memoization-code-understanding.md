let's break down the code step by step:

1. **Memoization Function (`memoize`):**
   - This function takes another function (`fn`) as input and returns a new function that memoizes the results of the original function.
   - Inside `memoize`, there's a `cache` object used to store the results of function calls.
   - The returned function (`memoizedFn`) checks if the result for a given set of arguments is already in the cache. If it is, it returns the cached result; otherwise, it calls the original function (`fn`), stores the result in the cache, and returns it.

2. **Original Functions (`sum`, `fib`, `factorial`):**
   - These are the original functions that you want to memoize.
   - `sum` takes two arguments `a` and `b` and returns their sum.
   - `fib` calculates the Fibonacci sequence recursively.
   - `factorial` calculates the factorial of a number recursively.

3. **Get Call Count Function (`getCallCount`):**
   - This function returns the number of unique function calls made so far. It's used for tracking the number of times the memoized function is called.

4. **Run Actions Function (`runActions`):**
   - This function takes the name of the function to memoize (`fnName`), an array of actions (`actions`), and an array of corresponding values (`values`).
   - It initializes `memoizedFn` based on `fnName`, using the `memoize` function.
   - It iterates through each action in the `actions` array and performs the corresponding action:
     - If the action is `"call"`, it calls `memoizedFn` with the provided arguments from `values` and adds the result to the `results` array.
     - If the action is `"getCallCount"`, it calls `getCallCount` and adds the result to the `results` array.
   - Finally, it returns the `results` array containing the results of each action.

5. **Example Usage:**
   - In the example usage, we specify `fnName` as `"sum"` and provide `actions` and `values` arrays.
   - We then call `runActions` with these inputs and log the results to the console.

Overall, this code demonstrates how to memoize functions and track their call count, providing a way to efficiently cache and reuse function results.
